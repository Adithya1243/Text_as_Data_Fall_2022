What I am interested to see are:\n\n-   What is the most common profession? Which areas of work do most of them fall into?\n-   How are they distributed demographically?\n-   What is the male vs female percentage in this list?\n-   Which time period did most of them existed?\n\n# Pie chart for country distribution\n\nIn my previous blog post, I have categorized the data into many ways where one of them is by nationality. I have studied the dataset, and defined a logic that will help me sort the data set.\n\nBelow is the code for a pie-chart for country distribution, where its evident that more than one-third of the list are from America primarily, followed by Britain at 19, and Europe with 13. One thing to note is, the 'Others list' consists of countries that have appeared only once. I've decided to group them together under a single identifier as it would be difficult to represent this in a pie chart.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmyPalette <- brewer.pal(5, \"Set2\")\npie(table(dataset$country), border = \"white\", col = myPalette, cex = 0.9)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blogpost4_100FamousPeople_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountry_data <- data.frame(country = dataset$country)\n\nPieChart(\n  country,\n  hole = 0,\n  values = \"input\",\n  data = country_data,\n  main = \"\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blogpost4_100FamousPeople_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n>>> suggestions\npiechart(country, hole=0)  # traditional pie chart\npiechart(country, values=\"%\")  # display %'s on the chart\npiechart(country)  # bar chart\nplot(country)  # bubble plot\nplot(country, values=\"count\")  # lollipop plot \n\n--- country --- \n\n      country Count   Prop \n--------------------------- \n      america    35   0.350 \n      british    19   0.190 \n       europe    13   0.130 \n       france     3   0.030 \n      germany     3   0.030 \n        india     3   0.030 \n       others    13   0.130 \n     pakistan     2   0.020 \n       russia     5   0.050 \nsouth_america     4   0.040 \n--------------------------- \n        Total   100   1.000 \n\nChi-squared test of null hypothesis of equal probabilities \n  Chisq = 99.600, df = 9, p-value = 0.000 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tree Map for Profession distribution\n\nTo have a variety of visualization, I have decided to use a tree-map to display the percentage of profession distribution. A large portion of the treemap is occupied by politicians. It is interesting to see the variety of backgrounds people have, specially the royalty and spiritual ones.\n\nThe second highest was occupied by 'Artists', followed by 'Academia' and 'Sports'\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create data\ntree_map_data <- data.frame(table(dataset$profession))\n\ncolnames(tree_map_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Var1\" \"Freq\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# treemap\ntreemap(tree_map_data,\n  index = \"Var1\",\n  vSize = \"Freq\",\n  type = \"index\",\n  border.col = c(\"black\", \"white\"),\n  border.lwds = c(2, 2),\n  title = \"Profession distribution\",\n  palette = \"Set2\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blogpost4_100FamousPeople_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \n\n# People's birth w.r.t to World Wars\n\nSince there were two world wars in the last century and most of the people listed here are born during that time, I thought it was interesting to see when were most of the people born. I divided that data into three straight-forward categories - Before WW1, Between world wars and After WW2 (where WW = World War).\n\nIt can be inferred from the graph that 41 people were born before World War 1 and 29 people after the second war, with 23 people being born between the wars.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbefore_ww1 <- dataset %>%\n  select(from) %>%\n  filter(from < 1913) %>%\n  nrow()\n\nbetween_wars <- dataset %>%\n  select(from) %>%\n  filter(from > 1913 & from < 1939) %>%\n  nrow()\nafter_ww2 <- dataset %>%\n  select(from) %>%\n  filter(from > 1945) %>%\n  nrow()\n\n# new graph =======================================\n\nera_df <- data.frame(\n  era = c(\"Before WW1(< 1914)\", \"Between Wars\", \"After WW2(>1945)\"),\n  value = c(\"41\", \"23\", \"29\")\n)\n\n\nggplot(era_df, aes(x = era, y = value, fill = era)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = value), vjust = 0) +\n  xlab(\"Era --->\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of people --->\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blogpost4_100FamousPeople_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Male Female Ratio\n\nAnother important metric to find out is the gender demographic. This categorization needed a lot of effort to perform, as there was a lot of trouble using regex to sort a person into male or female, depending on the pronouns used in their biography.\n\nFinally the his/her combination performed well to sort the data w.r.t gender. And it looks like 73 people were male while 23 of them were female.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(dataset$gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nfemale   male \n    27     73 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# taking values from the above result, creating a bar graph\n\ngender_df <- data.frame(\n  gender = c(\"Female\", \"Male\"),\n  value = c(\"27\", \"73\")\n)\n\n\nggplot(gender_df, aes(x = gender, y = value, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = value), vjust = 0) +\n  xlab(\"Gender\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blogpost4_100FamousPeople_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Topic Modeling\n\nThe Structural Topic Model allows researchers to flexibly estimate a topic model that includes document-level metadata. Estimation is accomplished through a fast variational approximation. The stm package provides many useful features, including rich ways to explore topics, estimate uncertainty, and visualize quantities of interest.\n\n## Why STM?\n\nThe data here is a collection of people's biographies. In other words, it is a collection of documents which when categorized, provides topic prevalence between the content come from document metadata. The outputs gives a bag of words related to that topic, and thee number of topics in related to that document.\n\n# Academicians of Britain\n\nTo begin with, I want to see the similarities between Academicians of Britain. They are filtered through the 'country' and 'profession' column, stored in a data frame for further processing.\n\nSome names I am familiar with are Charles Darwin, J.K Rowling, C.S Lewis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacademia_df <- dataset %>% filter(`profession` == \"academia\" & `country` == \"british\")\n\nacademia_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   X ...1   people_names                          peoples_title\n1 15   15     C.S.

Lewis was an author, essayist and Christian apologist. He is best known for his children’s classic series – The Chronicles of Narnia.Clive Staples Lewis was born on 29 November 1898 and lived until 22 November 1963. He was born in Belfast, North Ireland into a Protestant Ulster family. Throughout his life, he retained strong roots to Ireland. He sought out the company of the Irish and took an active interest in Celtic literature and myths. He was a keen admirer of the works of W.B.Yeats, at a time when he was relatively unknown in England.Lewis was educated at a variety of private tuition and public schools such as Malvern in Worcestershire. His time in public school was not particularly happy, and he later wrote in disparaging times of how schoolboys were mistreated. However, in 1916, Lewis was offered a scholarship at University College, Oxford University. He proved an excellent student, ultimately, gaining a triple first (the top classification in three different degrees). In 1917, his university life was interrupted as he volunteered to join the British army in the First World War. He was transferred to the Somme valley where he took part in trench warfare.In the last months of the war, he was injured by a shell and was sent home to recuperate from his injuries. During his period of convalescence, he became increasingly friendly with Mrs Moore – the mother of a close army friend Edward ‘Paddy’ Moore. He remained very close to Mrs Moore, often referring to her as his mother until her death in the 1940s.On returning to Oxford, C.S.Lewis completed his degrees before taking up a post teaching English at Magdalen College, Oxford from 1925 to 1954. He was a prolific writer and formed a close friendship with other Oxford fellows such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, and Owen Barfield. They formed an informal group known as the ‘Inklings’. They would meet at pubs in Oxford such as ‘The Eagle and Child’ where they would read parts of their novels. He encouraged Tolkien as he wrote his epic ‘The Lord of the Rings.’C.S.Lewis and ChristianityLewis was brought up in the Protestant Church of Ireland, but as a teenager, he said he lost his faith – turned off by boring church services and the problem of evil in the world. However, after returning to Oxford in the post-war period, he became increasingly perplexed by the existence of God and Christianity. After many evening chats with friends such as J.R.R.Tolkien and Hugo Dyson, C.S.Lewis finally converted to belief in God (theism) in 1929 and became a Christian in 1931. C.S. Lewis later wrote he felt a reluctant and unwilling convert. But, felt compelled to accept the evidence of faith. In his book, “Surprised by Joy” he writes that he came to Christianity:“kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape.”C.S.Lewis became an influential apologist for Christianity through publications such as the “Screwtape Letters”. He concentrated on a more universal form of Christianity seeking to avoid the sectarianism that was common in his native Northern Ireland. He rarely made any specific reference to a particular denomination of Christianity but sought to reinforce the underlying Christian values shared by all Christian faiths. However, he always remained an Anglican and, to the disappointment of Tolkien, he never converted to Roman Catholicism.His Christian beliefs also influenced his more popular works such as the “Chronicles of Narnia”. Though he also includes ideas of Roman and Celtic myths, there are underlying Christian notions of sacrifice and Christ-like actions. Lewis began writing  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe during the Second World War. He was partly inspired by three evacuee children who came to stay in his home in Risinghurst (a suburb of Oxford). Lewis said the experience of the evacuee children gave him a new perspective on the joy of childhood. Lewis also remarked he had had an image of a Faun since he was about 16.“The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: ‘Let’s try to make a story about it.”The seven book in the series were published one per year from 1950 to 1956. They soon became a publishing success and have become a very influentials genre of children’s books.

Joy later moved to Oxford and the two gained a civil marriage contract enabling Joy to live in the UK. C.S.Lewis very much enjoyed the company of Joy, finding an ideal partner to share his intellectual and spiritual interests. Joy Gresham died from cancer in 1957. Their love story has been romanticised in the popular film – “Shadowlands.”C.S.Lewis died a few years later in 1963 from renal failure. His death occurred on the same date as the assassination of J.F. Kennedy.Since his death, his books and influence have continued to grow. He has been rated as one of the top English writers of all time and his books have been translated into numerous languages.\n2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Charles Darwin (1809 – 1882) was an English Natural scientist who laid down a framework for the theory of evolution – showing how Man evolved from lower life forms. At the time, his research and publication led to bitter controversy, but his theory of evolution and natural selection later became accepted within the scientific community.Charles Darwin was born on 12 February 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He was born into a wealthy and influential family. His grandfathers included – China manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, and Erasmus Darwin, one of the leading intellectuals of 18th century England.Darwin planned to study medicine at Edinburgh University, but later, at the instigation of his father, changed to studying Divinity at Christ’s College, Cambridge University. Darwin was not a great student, preferring to spend time in outdoor pursuits; he spent a lot of time examining natural science and beetle collecting. After gaining a passionate interest in natural science, Darwin was offered a place on the HMS Beagle to act as a natural scientist on a voyage to the coast of South America.At the time, religion was a powerful force in society, and most people took the Bible as the infallible, literal word of God. This included the belief that God created the world in seven days, and the world was only a few thousand years old. However, on the voyage, Darwin increasingly began to see evidence of life being much older. In particular Lyell’s ‘Principles of Geology’ suggested that fossils were evidence of animals living hundreds of thousands of years ago.On the voyage, Darwin made copious notes about specimens he found on his voyages. In particular, at the Galapagos Islands 500 miles west of South America, Darwin was struck by how the Finch was different on each individual island. He noticed that the Finch had somehow adapted to the various aspects of the particular island.Over the next 20 years, Darwin worked on the dilemma of how species evolve and can end up being quite different on different islands. Influenced by the work of Thomas Malthus, Darwin came up with a theory of natural selection and gradual evolution over time.“In the struggle for survival, the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best to their environment.”– Charles DarwinDarwin continued to refine his theory, and would intensively breed plants to work on his theories. However, realising how controversial his ideas were, Darwin delayed publishing them. It was not until learning that another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace had developed similar ideas, that Darwin was galvanised into publishing his own book.In 1859, the ground-breaking ‘On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection‘ was published. It immediately gained widespread interest and attention, leading to intense debate about the contention that man – by implication was descended from animals like the ape.“Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relationship to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring.”– Charles Darwin, Origin of Species (1859)However, by the time he died on 19 April 1882, his ideas had increasingly become accepted – at least by the scientific and non-religious society. He was given a state burial at Westminster Abbey.Darwin’s Religious BeliefsDarwin was brought up in the Church of England, and at one point was being trained to be an Anglican priest. Like many of his generation, he took the Bible as the literal word of God and often quoted it as a source of moral authority. However, after his epic voyage to South America, he became doubtful of the Bible as a source of history; he also felt no reason why all religions couldn’t be true.From 1849, he stopped going to church, though he never considered himself to be an atheist. He felt that ‘agnostic’ suited his beliefs more closely. He wrote in his autobiography that he eventually gave up Christianity as he disagreed with the conclusion that all non-believers spend eternity in hell.“I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.”He was politically liberal, being an opponent of slavery. He experienced the brutality of how people treated their slaves in a Spanish colony.“I have watched how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it!” ( =  || [])({});Letter to J. S.

His relatively small numbers of books have created intense literary and political criticism. Orwell was a socialist, but at the same time, he did not fit into any neat ideology. He is best known for his novels “1984” and “Animal Farm” – which both warn about the dangers of a totalitarian state. Completed just after the Second World War, they touched a chord because of contemporary fears over the growing influence of state control. He was foremost a political writer, but for Orwell, his object was not to promote a certain point of view but to arrive at the truth; exposing the hypocrisy and injustice prevalent in society.Orwell’s Early lifeOrwell was born Eric Blair on 25 June 1903, in Motihari, Bihar, in India. Shortly after his birth, he was taken by his mother back to Oxfordshire, England. His family were financially poor, but an aspiring middle-class family. Orwell described it as ‘lower-upper-middle-class’ – a reflection of the importance he felt the English attached to class labels.With his family unable to afford fees to a proper public school, he was educated at St Cyprian’s in Eastbourne, which served as a preliminary crammer to gaining a scholarship for public schools like Eton. In a later essay “Such, Such were the Joys” he was scathing of his time at St Cyprian’s noting how difficult it was to be happy in such a mean-spirited environment. Aged 14, he was able to move to Eton, where he had better memories because of the greater intellectual stimulation. However, the awareness of being much poorer than many of his school friends remained. He left Eton with firmly held “middle class” values but at the same time a sense of unease with his social position.After school, he was unable to afford university, and for want of a better option, Orwell took a job with the Burmese civil service. It was here in Burma, that Orwell would begin to assert his independence from his privileged upbringing. Revealingly, Orwell later told how he found himself rooting for the local population, and despising the imperial ideology which he represented. He resigned from his position in 1927. In an essay Shooting the Elephant he describes he feelings on Burma:“Theoretically and secretly of course, I was always for the Burmese and all against the oppressors, the British. As for the job I was doing I hated it more bitterly than I can perhaps make clear” (1)It was in the nature of George Orwell to try and see a situation from other people’s point of view. He was unhappy at accepting the conventional social wisdom. In fact, he grew to despise his middle-class upbringing so much he decided to spend time as a tramp. He wanted to experience life from the view of the gutter. His vivid experiences are recorded in his book “Down and out in Paris and London”. No longer could Orwell be described as a “Champagne Socialist”; by living with the poorest and underprivileged,  he gained a unique insight into the practical workings of working class ideas and working-class politics.The Road to Wigan PierIn the middle of the great depression, Orwell undertook another experience travelling to Wigan; an industrial town in Lancashire experiencing the full effects of mass unemployment and poverty. Orwell freely admitted how, as a young child, he was brought up to despise the working class. He vividly tells how he was obsessed with the idea that the working classes smelt:“At a distance.. I could agonise over their sufferings, but I still hated them and despised them when I came anywhere near them.” (2)The Road to Wigan Pier offered a penetrating insight into the condition of the working classes. It was also a right of passage for Orwell to live amongst the people he had once, from a distance, despised. The Road to Wigan Pier inevitably had a political message, but characteristically of Orwell, it was not all pleasing to the left. For example, it was less than flattering towards the Communist party. This was despite the book being promoted by a mostly Communist organisation – The Left Book club.Orwell and the Spanish Civil WarIt was fighting in the Spanish Civil war that Orwell came to really despise Communist influences. In 1936, Orwell volunteered to fight for the fledgeling Spanish Republic, who at the time were fighting the Fascist forces of General  Franco. It was a conflict that polarised nations. To the left, the war was a symbol of a real socialist revolution, based on the principles of equality and freedom. It was for these ideals that many international volunteers, from around the world, went to Spain to fight on behalf of the Republic. Orwell found himself in the heart of the Socialist revolution in Barcelona. He was assigned to an Anarchist – Trotskyist party – P.O.U.M. More than most other left-wing parties, they believed in the ideal of a real Marxist revolution. To members of the P.O.U.M, the war was not just about fighting the Fascist menace but also delivering a Socialist revolution for the working classes. In his book, “Homage to Catalonia” Orwell writes of his experiences; he notes the inefficiency with which the Spanish fought even wars. He was enthused by the revolutionary fervour of some of his party members; however, one of the overriding impressions was his perceived betrayal of the Republic, by the Stalinist backed Communist party.“the Communists stood not upon the extreme Left, but upon the extreme right. In reality this should come as no surprise, because the tactics of the Communist parties elsewhere” (3)Unwittingly he found himself engaged in a civil war amongst the left, as the Soviet Union backed Communist party turned on the Trotskyite factions like P.O.U.M. In the end, Orwell narrowly escaped with his life, after being shot in the throat. He was able to return to England, but he had learnt at first hand how revolutions could easily be betrayed; ideas that would later shape his seminal work “Animal Farm.”Orwell at the BBCDuring the Second World War, Orwell was declared unfit for active duty. He actively supported the war effort from the start. (He didn’t wait for the Soviet Union to enter like some communists.) He also began writing for the left-leaning magazine ‘The Tribune’ which was associated with the left of the Labour Party. Orwell was appointed editor and was enthusiastic in supporting the radical Labour government of 1945, which implemented a national health service, welfare state and nationalisation of major industries. However, Orwell was not just focused on politics, he took an active interest in working class life and English culture. His short essays investigated aspects of English life from fish and chips to the eleven rules of making a good cup of tea.Orwell described himself as a secular humanist and could be critical of organised religion in his writings. However, he had a fondness for the social and cultural aspect of the Church of England and attended services intermittently.Barnhill. JuraHe married Eileen O’Shaughnessy in 1936 and in 1944, they adopted a three-week old child – Richard Horatio. Orwell was devastated when Eileen died and sought to remarry – seeking a mother for his young son. He asked several women for their hand in marriage, with Sonia Branwell accepting in 1949 – despite Orwell’s increasingly poor health. Orwell was a heavy smoker and this affected his lungs causing bronchial problems. In the last years of his life, he moved to a remote farm on the Scottish island of Jura to concentrate on his writings. Orwell passed away on 21 January 1950. His friend David Astor helped him to be buried at Sutton Courtenay churchyard, Oxfordshire.The two great novels of Orwell were “Animal Farm” and “1984”. Animal Farm is a simple allegory for revolutions which go wrong, based primarily on the Russian revolution. 1984 is a dystopian nightmare about the dangers of a totalitarian state which gains complete control over its citizens.

Her childhood was generally happy, although she does remember getting teased because of her name, “Rowling” – She recalls often getting called “Rowling pin” by her less than ingenious school friends. J.K. Rowling says she never really warmed to her own name, although, she does remember having a fondness for the name Potter from quite an early age. J.K.Rowling studied at St Michael’s Primary School in Gloucestershire, before moving to Chepstow, South Wales at the age of nine.From an early age, J.K. Rowling had the ambition to be a writer. She often tried her hand at writing, although little came from her early efforts. Aged six she wrote a book about a rabbit with measles. After her mother praised her effort. Rowling replied ‘well get it published then.’ She admits it was a ‘Bit of an odd thing for a child of six to think. I don’t know where it came from…”In her own autobiography, she remembers with great fondness, when her good friend Sean became the first person to give her the confidence that one day she would be able to make a very good writer.“he was also the only person who thought I was bound to be a success at it, which meant much more to me than I ever told him at the time” (1)Sean was also the owner of a battered old Ford Anglia, which would later appear in one of the Harry Potter series as a flying car.After finishing school, her parents encouraged her to study French at the University of Exeter. She slightly regretted choosing French, saying she would have preferred to study English. However, it was her parents wish that she study something “ more useful” than English.After having spent a year in Paris, J.K.Rowling graduated from university and took various jobs in London. One of her favourite jobs was working for Amnesty International; the charity, which campaigns against human rights abuses throughout the world. Amnesty International, is one of the many charities, which J.K.Rowling has generously supported since she attained a new found wealth.It was in 1990 that J.K.Rowling first conceived of the idea about Harry Potter. As she recalls, it was on a long train journey from Manchester to London when she began forming in her mind, the characters of the series. At the forefront, was a young boy, at that time not aware that he was a wizard. The train was delayed for over four hours, but she didn’t have a pen and was too shy to ask for one nothing,“To my immense frustration, I didn’t have a pen that worked, and I was too shy to ask anybody if I could borrow one.”But she remembers being very enthusiastic, and excited about the ideas which were filling her mind.On arriving at her flat in Clapham Junction, she began work on writing the book immediately, although, it would take several years to come to fruition.It was also in December of 1990 that J.K.Rowling lost her mother, who died of Multiple Sclerosis. J.K.Rowling was very close to her mother, and she felt the loss deeply. Her own loss gave an added poignancy to the death of Harry Potter’s mother in her book. She says her favourite scene in the Philosopher’s Stone is, The Mirror of Erised, where Harry sees his parents in the mirror.In 1991, J.K.Rowling left England to get a job as an English teacher in Portugal. It was here that she met her first husband, Jorge Arantes – and together they had a child Jessica. However, after a couple of years, the couple split after a fierce argument; where by all accounts J.K.Rowling was thrown out of the house.In Dec 1993, Rowling returned to the UK, moving to Edinburgh where she tried to finish her first book. She was surviving on state benefits and bringing up her daughter as a single parent. She would often go to Edinburgh cafes to work on the book whilst her child had a nap.Eventually, she finished her first copy of “The Philosopher’s Stone ”, and sent it off to various agents. She found an agent, Christopher, who spent over a year trying to get a publisher. It was rejected by 12 major publishing houses. But, eventually, a quite small publisher, Bloomsbury agreed to take the book on. The editor Barry Cunningham also agreed to pay her an advance of £1500. The decision to take on the book was, in large part, due to his eight-year-old daughter’s enthusiastic reception of the first chapter (However she was advised to continue her training as a teacher because she was told writers of children’s books don’t tend to get very well paid.)“There’s always room for a story that can transport people to another place.”– J.K.Rowling [1]Within a few weeks of publication, (1996) book sales really started to take off. The initial print run was of only 1,000 – 500 of which went to libraries. First editions are now said to be worth up to £25,000 each. She also received a grant from the Scottish arts council, which enabled her to write full time. After the books initial success in the UK, an American company Scholastic agreed to pay a remarkable £100,000 for the rights to publish in America. In 1998, Warner Bros secured the film rights to the books, giving a seven-figure sum. The films have magnified the success of the books, making Harry Potter into one of the most recognisable media products. Under the close guidance of J.K.Rowling, the films have sought to stay close to the original plot; also at J.K.Rowling’s request, all the actors are British and are filmed in Britain.On the 21st December 2006, J.K.Rowling finished her final book of the Harry Potter Series – “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” (Amazon). The book was released in July 2007, becoming one of the fastest selling books of all time. J.K.Rowling has said the book is her favourite, and it makes her both happy and sad. She has said she will continue writing but there is little chance of continuing the Harry Potter Series. She has published a dictionary of things related to Hogwarts and Harry Potter, that were never published in other books.Since the end of her Harry Potter series, she says she has finished some short stories, she also hinted on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1st October 2010, that an 8th book in the Harry Potter series is a possibility.On 27 September 2012, Rowling released the ‘Casual Vacancy’ an adult novel – to mixed reviews. In 2013, The Cuckoo’s Calling was published. Initially, the author was stated as being Robert Galbraith. But, this was a pseudonym used by J.K.Rowling. After her authorship was discovered, sales went through the roof.J.K.Rowling and MediaJ.K.Rowling has sought to protect her children from media intrusion. In 2011, she gave testimony to the Leverson enquiry about how unscrupulous reporters sought to intrude into her family’s privacy. After her books became best-sellers, reporters would often be camped outside her home. J.K. Rowling said:“However, as interest in Harry Potter and myself increased, my family and I became the target of a different kind of journalistic activity. The effect on me, and our family life, truly cannot be overstated. We were literally driven out of the first house I had ever owned (which faced almost directly onto the street) because of journalists banging on the door, questioning the neighbours and sitting in parked cars immediately outside the gate. Old friendships were tested as journalists turned up on their doorsteps, and offered money for stories on me. “(J.K.Rowling’s Testimony to Leveson Enquiry Nov 2011.)After finding a letter from a journalist in her child’s satchel, she remarked:“It’s very difficult to say how angry I felt that my 5-year-old daughter’s school was no longer a place of complete security from journalists.”J.K.Rowling currently lives in Scotland, on the banks of the River Tay, with her 2nd husband Neil Murray; J.K.Rowling has three children, two with husband Neil.Inspiration to writeSpeaking on a BBC Radio Programme “The Museum of Curiosity”, 23 December 2019, Rowling talked about the process by which she writes. She says she imagines she walks through a forest towards a lake. At the lake, she waits for an inspiration to emerge from its depth. Then she takes this back to her cottage where she has to polish the dream-like inspiration until it is in a fit state to publish. To Rowling, writing is a dual process – gaining inspiration from an unknown source and then working on the inspiration to make it a solid reality. She prefaced the story by saying she was reluctant to explain her process as it was difficult to explain.Wealth of J.K.RowlingIn 2017, according to Forbes, her estimated wealth stands at $650 million, it would be higher but she has donated substantial sums to charity. The global Harry Potter brand is estimated to be worth £7 billion.Charity Work of J.K.RowlingJ.K.Rowling has contributed considerable sums to charities she supports. This includes:Anti-Poverty. She is President of the Charity – One Parent FamiliesMultiple sclerosis. She has contributed money to the research and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, which her mother suffered from.Lumos – helping institutionalised children in Eastern EuropePolitical ViewsShe has publically supported the Labour party. In 2008, she donated £1 million to the Labour party, saying she felt vulnerable families would be better off under a Labour government. She describes her political hero as Robert F.Kennedy.Religious ViewsJ.K.Rowling states that she considers herself a Christian, and attends a local Church of Scotland congregation. She said, that unlike other members in her family, she often had a deep interest in religion, and would go to churches alone. However, she also says that although she believes in God, at times she doubts her faith.“I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of uncertainty. I live in a state of spiritual flux. I believe in the permanence of the soul.”– J.K.Rowling (2008, interview in El Pais – a Spanish Newspaper) ( =  || [])({});More facts about J.K. Rowling\n5 J R R Tolkien (1892 – 1973) English author, philologist and poet. Tolkien was best known for his fantasy creations of Middle-Earth – writing The Hobbit, and the epic trilogy ‘The Lord of the Rings’. The Lord of the Rings made him one of the best selling authors of the Twentieth Century, spawning a new genre of fantasy.Early life J.R.R. TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien was born in 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa. After three years in South Africa, he returned to England with his Mother Mabel; unfortunately, his father died one year later, leaving him with little memory of his father. His early childhood was, by all accounts, a happy one; he was brought up in the Warwickshire countryside (many regard this idealised upbringing as the basis for the Shire in Lord of the Rings).In 1904, when John was just 12, his mother Mabel died from diabetes leaving a profound mark on him and his brother. After his mother’s passing, he was brought up by the family’s Catholic priest, Father Francis Morgen. From an early age, J.R.R. Tolkien was an excellent scholar, with an unusually specialised interest in languages. He enjoyed studying languages especially Greek, Anglo Saxon, and later at Oxford, Finnish.Although a scholar at King Edward VI school, he initially failed to win a scholarship to Oxford. This was partly due to falling in love with his childhood sweetheart Edith. On finding out about this romance, his guardian Father Francis Morgan, prohibited John from seeing Edith until he was 21 and no longer under his care. Father Morgen made John promise not to see Edith, and John reluctantly agreed to his request. John faithfully waited until his 21st birthday, and on this date, he renewed his contact with Edith and successfully persuaded her to marry him. It is a testament to his belief in faithfulness and honesty that he was willing to wait several years to meet his wife; such sentiments of nobility frequently appear in his writings; for example, the magnificent love story of ‘Beren and Luthien’ (The Silmarillion 1977).J.R.R.Tolkien in OxfordFrom an academic point of view, his separation from Edith seemed to do the trick, and a year later he won an exhibition at Exeter College, Oxford where he would study classics. John did not particularly shine in this subject and grew to enjoy the pleasures of University life, though his meagre income made it difficult to keep up with the spending habits of more affluent students. Uninspired by the classics, John was able to switch to his real love – English literature. He was a competent scholar, but a lot of his time was spent researching other languages in the Bodleian library. It was here in Oxford that he became fascinated with Finnish, a language which would form the basis for Quenya; a language he would later give to his Elves. His love of languages remained with Tolkien throughout his life; in particular, he began developing his own languages, a remarkable undertaking. In fact, he later commented that languages lied at the heart of his Middle Earth creations. Tolkien said the stories existed to provide an opportunity to use the languages. Devotees of the book may not agree, but it does illustrate the profound importance he attached to the use of language.J.R.R.Tolkien and the First World WarAt the outbreak of the First World War, J.R.R. Tolkien decided to finish off his degree before enlisting in 1916. Joining the Lancashire Fusiliers, he made it to the Western Front just before the great Somme offensive. At first hand, J.R.R. Tolkien witnessed the horrors and carnage of the “Great War”; he lost many close friends, tellingly he remarked “By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead”. J.R.R. Tolkien survived, mainly due to the persistent re-occurrence of trench fever, which saw him invalided back to England.  He rarely talked about his experiences directly, but the large-scale horrors of war will undoubtedly have influenced his writings in some way. Perhaps the imagery for the wastelands of Mordor may have had a birth in the muddy horrors of the Western Front.It was back in England, in 1917, that J.R.R Tolkien began working on his epic – “The Silmarillion“. The Silmarillion lies at the heart of all Tolkien’s mythology, it is a work he continually revised until his death in 1973. The Silmarillion makes hard reading, in that, it is not plot driven, but depicts the history of a universe, through an almost biblical overview. It moves from the Creation of the Universe to the introduction of evil and the rebellion of the Noldor. It is in The Silmarillion that many roots from the Lord of the Rings stem. It gives the Lord of the Rings the impression of a real epic. It becomes not just a story, but also the history of an entire world and peoples.Writing the HobbitInitially, J.R.R Tolkien’s writings on The Silmarillion were known by very few. He found his time absorbed in teaching and other duties of being a professor. He also found time to write important papers on medieval literature. These included seminal works on, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and Beowulf. In 1945, he was given the Merton professorship and gained additional duties of teaching and lecturing.The HobbitIt was sometime after 1930 that Tolkien gained an unexpected inspiration to start writing the Hobbit. It was whilst marking an examination paper that he jotted in the margins of a paper the immortal words; “In a hole in the ground lived a hobbit.” Unlike the Silmarillion, The Hobbit was a simple fairy tale and adventure for children. Hinting at evil things, it still ends in a happy ending for all and is primarily concerned with a triumph of good over evil. In the course of the next few years friends, including C.S. Lewis, read his manuscript and gave good reviews. In the course of time, the publisher Allen and Unwin were sent a copy. Rayner, the 10-year-old son of Mr Unwin, gave a glowing reference and the Hobbit was published in 1937 to great commercial success.J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. LewisJ.R.R.Tolkien was good friends with C.S. Lewis and together they were key members of the ‘Inklings’ an informal Oxford literary club, where writers met together to read out poetry and short stories. Tolkien had a strong Catholic faith throughout his life; he often discussed religion with C.S.Lewis. Lewis later said that his conversations with Tolkien were a key factor in his decision to embrace Christianity. However, their relationship cooled over the years. There was a little friction over C.S.Lewis relationship with Joy Davidson, but they remained firm friends and C.S.Lewis was always a stout literary defender of Tolkien’s work. (Though Tolkien was somewhat less enthusiastic about the work of C.S.Lewis.)Lord of the RingsDue to the success of The Hobbit, Allen and Unwin encouraged J.R.R. Tolkien to write a sequel. Thus, over a period of many years, J.R.R. Tolkien began writing The Lord of the Rings. This soon became quite different to The Hobbit, both in scope and dimension. Putting its roots into the characters and history of The Silmarillion, it became an epic of unprecedented depth. No longer was Tolkien writing a simplistic adventure story; in The Lord of the Rings, the triumph of good over evil is no longer so complete. Even with the mission’s success, there is no obvious happy ending. There is a feeling of permanent change – nothing can remain as it is. As well as being a fascinating storyline, the book deals with many issues of how people respond to certain choices and the influence of power and ego. It can be read in many ways, but it does offer an underlying moral and spiritual dimension, which is inherent in the development of the story.Due to the sheer scope and length of the book, the publishers Allen and Unwin were wary of publication. They worried about whether it would be a commercial success. Eventually, they decided to publish the book, but split it up into six sections; they also offered no payment to J.R.R Tolkien, until the book moved into profit. The first edition was published in 1954 and soon became a good seller. However, it was in 1965 when the book was published in America, that it really took off becoming an international bestseller. Somehow the book managed to capture the mood of the 1960s counterculture, and it became immensely popular on American campuses. Tolkien became a household name, and The Lord of the Rings would soon become renowned as the most popular book of all time.Although the book has received the most powerful popular acclaim, it has not always received the same commendation from the literary world. In 1972, Oxford University conferred on Tolkien the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters. This was not for his writing, but his researches on linguistic studies. Tolkien, however, would have taken no offence at this award. For Tolkien, his linguistic studies were as important if not more so than his fictional literary endeavours.He did not particularly enjoy the fame that came from his literary success, and in 1968 he moved to Poole to gain a little more privacy. Speaking of his own simple tastes he described his similarity to hobbits.“I am in fact a Hobbit (in all but size). I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food (unrefrigerated), but detest French cooking; I like, and even dare to wear in these dull days, ornamental waistcoats. I am fond of mushrooms (out of a field); have a very simple sense of humour (which even my appreciative critics find tiresome); I go to bed late and get up late (when possible). I do not travel much.”– Letter to Deborah Webster (25 October 1958)His wife Edith died in 1971, and J.R.R. Tolkien died a couple of years later in 1973. After his death, his creations gained increased popularity and sales. Even before the release of The Lord of the Rings films, the book, “Lord of the Rings” was often voted as best-loved books of all time. His son, Christopher Tolkien, carefully went through all his manuscripts, and published posthumously several histories of middle earth, encompassing various early drafts of stories and histories.

Keynes (5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946) was one of the most influential economists of the Twentieth Century. His groundbreaking work in the 1930s led to the development of a whole new economic discipline dedicated to macroeconomics. His economic theories, which became known as ‘Keynesianism’ advocated government intervention to end the Great Depression.John M. Keynes was born in Cambridge to an upper-middle-class family. His father was a lecturer in economics and moral sciences at Cambridge University. He was a bright scholar who won a scholarship to Eton College. After Eton, he studied Maths at Kings College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, the great economist Alfred Marshall encouraged Keynes to take up the relatively new science of Economics. Keynes published his first economic article in 1909, and by 1911 was editor of the Economic Journal.During the First World War, Keynes acted as a government advisor for the government. He helped to negotiate terms with Britain’s creditors (UK debt rose sharply in World War One). At the end of the First World War, Keynes took part in the British delegation to the Treaty of Versailles. Keynes was shocked at the level of reparations the Allies wanted to impose on the Germans. Keynes resigned from the British delegation saying it was a recipe for bankrupting Germany. He wrote the Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919, accurately predicting the difficulties Germany would have and the consequent political resentment at such as harsh peace treaty.“If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp.”The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919)  Chapter VII, Section 1, pg.268In the 1920s, Keynes wrote a powerful critique of Britain’s decision to return to the Gold Standard at a pre-1914 level. Keynes argued that the artificially high value of sterling would make life difficult for British exporters. The decision to return to the Gold Standard in 1925 was widely blamed for the prolonged deflation and high unemployment the UK experienced in the 1920s. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, who was responsible for the decision admitted it was the biggest domestic mistake of his career.Keynes and the Great DepressionIt was the Great Depression of 1929-39, which gave Keynes the opportunity to disparage and challenge the classical orthodoxy which dominated economic theory at the time. At the outbreak of the Great Depression, the classical response was to rely on free markets and balance the budget – through tax increases and cutting government spending. In 1931, Keynes was particularly critical of Ramsay McDonald’s austerity budget which cut public investment, wages and increased taxes. Keynes argued that the government should be doing the opposite. Throughout the 1930s, Keynes was a consistent voice for advocating higher government spending funded through higher borrowing. However, in most democracies, it proved a lone voice – apart from intermittent spending as part of Roosevelt’s New Deal.The basic principle of Keynes’ work was that in a recession, there were wasted resources due to higher private savings and falling private sector investment and spending. Therefore, the government should intervene. The government should borrow from the surplus savings of the private sector and help unemployed resources, lying idle, to become used. See more at explanation of Keynesian economicsKeynes was also a great publicist for his own views, with a knack for attracting attention. For example, when he saw a waiter with nothing to do, he knocked some serviettes on to the floor. He explained to his bemused friends he was trying to prevent unemployment by creating work. In his General Theory, he used the analogy of digging holes in the ground to explain concepts of aggregate demand.“To dig holes in the ground“, paid for out of savings, will increase, not only employment, but the real national dividend of useful goods and services. It is not reasonable, however, that a sensible community should be content to remain dependent on such fortuitous and often wasteful mitigations when once we understand the influences upon which effective demand depends.”– J.M. Keynes, The General Theory Of Employment, Interest, And Money Ch 4.His work created some notable soundbites – he popularised the idea of the paradox of thrift (individual saving causes aggregate spending to fall). He also coined the phrase ‘in the long run we are all dead’.“The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.”– J.M. Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform (1923) Ch. 3.This phrase was an ironic criticism of classical theory, which argued markets would eventually return to equilibrium ‘in the long run.’His groundbreaking work – The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936) provided a framework for macroeconomics and was a radical departure from the more limited classical framework. After the war, to varying degrees, governments in the West pursued Keynesian demand management in an attempt to achieve full employment. This led the US president R. Nixon to declare in the 1960s – “we’re all Keynesians now.”In the 1970s, the reputation of Keynes’ work was challenged by the stagflation of the decade and the response of neo-classical economists and monetarists, such as Milton Friedman. But, the great recession of 2008-2013, led to a resurgence of interest in Keynes’ explanation for prolonged recessions.In 1940, his health suffered, and he had to cut back on his workload. However, after the Second World War, he was asked to take part in the British negotiations with America over debt repayments. It was Keynes’ job to emphasise to the Americans how bankrupt the UK was. The American delegation who met Keynes was deeply impressed by his intellect and passion. Though they couldn’t meet his demands until Congress became worried about the spread of Communism in Europe, and agreed to extend the terms of credit.Outside economics, Keynes was a lover of the arts, opera and noted for his exceptional wit. He was a formidable intellect and even critics admitted he had both great intellect and powers of persuasion.“Every time I argued with Keynes, I felt that I took my life in my hands and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool.”– Bertrand RussellAustrian economist Friedrich Hayek who came up with an economic theory (Austrian economics), very different to Keynes, wrote:“He was the one really great man I ever knew, and for whom I had unbounded admiration. The world will be a very much poorer place without him.”Another quality of Keynes was his optimism and belief in finding a solution. While many despaired at the social and economic cost of the Great Depression, to Keynes he saw a way out – it need not be like this.

However, in the 1930s, he saw his financial investments make a good return, as he made a number of astute investments. He was a member of the Bloomsbury Group, a fashionable society of Cambridge graduates, who also included Virginia Woolf and E.M.ForsterKeynes married the ballerina Lydia Lopokova but had a number of affairs with both women and men.He tragically died from a heart attack in 1946, just as he was helping to implement the post-war economic settlement and set up the Bretton-Woods system.\n   from    to profession country gender\n1 1948   2022   academia british   male\n2 1809   1882   academia british   male\n3 1903   1950   academia british   male\n4 1965   2022   academia british female\n5 1942   2022   academia british   male\n6 1883   1946   academia british   male\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Topic Modeling\n\nHere, using the stm package, I am pre-processing the text by removing stopwords, punctuation, converting the words to lowercase and stemming them.

No matter how I tweak this, it is throwing an \"out of bounds\" error. So, after experimenting with different K values, I've decided to go with k=8, using which I could interpret better.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfindingK <- searchK(academia_prepped$documents,\n  academia_prepped$vocab,\n  K = 2,\n  data = academia_prepped$meta,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in missing$docs[[i]]: subscript out of bounds\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(findingK)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in plot(findingK): object 'findingK' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Interpretation\n\nI am able to see the correlation between topics 2,4,6,7,8 for those categorized as academicians from Britain. Stories and struggles of people like J.K Rowling, Charles Darwin, C.S Lewis are shown in these results. Their life stories show passion, setbacks and growth on their literary works. Though they faced a lot of criticism, their works were became popular after some of the people passed away.\n\nThere is one big influencing factor in their works. For JK Rowling, it was the train journey and the past events. For George Orwell, it was the oppression and current political situation, and for Charles Darwin it was his overseas voyage and innate sense of curiosity. None of them were primarily focused on traditional forms of learning, and each were going through a rough phase of life. Topics 6 and 7 about success with their books and tough times in their relationships. Topic 2, 8 talks about how their social life was a big influence in shaping their ideas and how they became renowned as the most influential people of all time.\n\n# Future Steps\n\nI want to perform topic modeling on politicians and artists of USA, India, and Russia to see similarities between them. It would be interesting to see what I can be interpreted with these countries.\n",
